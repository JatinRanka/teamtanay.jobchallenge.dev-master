Start with my youtube channel and make first 3 apps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvhQUIpvvug-c-bExl_xFcopeQi_sa29\"><em>Portfolio</em></a> teaches you basic HTML/CSS, Git and Hosting</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvhQUIpvvuj9nN70USkHJrrSeQ9aiqdB\"><em>Expense calculator</em></a> starts up with basic JavaScript</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvhQUIpvvuhRWpaMj-2iHjkL1kUBK7yW\"><em>Diet calculator</em></a> introduces you very slowly to React.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then, go through advance courses at other places. You can find a curated list of these courses in my social media profiles and in this website itself. You need to make 3 more projects after it. I’ll give ideas for that too.</p>\n<p>Document your journey alongside. This will help you build a network as well as grasp new things quickly.</p>\n<p>But again, if you’re an absolute beginner, get started with the basics now. Read MDN docs and practice everyday. Get help from our community whenever you’re stuck, we’re always happy to help. Indeed, you’ll have to work harder than other participants, but the growth and comfort do not co-exist.</p>\n<p>There are same rules for everyone irrespective of your age or year of college. It’s not like college has taught anyone anything here. So first year or last year or a passout, there’s literally no difference. Start now, start with doubt, just start. Make it happen, shock everyone.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"how to get started as a beginner?","date":null,"description":null,"type":"faq"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/09_how-to-get-visibility copy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/01.5_has-challenge-strarted/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"is the challenge live now?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/98_where_can_i_clear_my_doubts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"what are some platforms where I can discuss and clear my doubts in future?"}}}}}

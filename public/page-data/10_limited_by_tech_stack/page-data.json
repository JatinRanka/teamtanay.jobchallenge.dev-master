However, my suggestion would be to go with React and React Native. Getting a job is much easier with React stack.</p>\n<p>With React/React Native, you’re more likely to get the interviews as my network has more React/React Native/Node.js openings. So there’s a high chance to get a job interview/offer when you get a shout-out from my network handles and when the hiring partners want to interview you.</p>\n<p>This also could be a great opportunity for you to learn a new framework/library.\nAlthough, you can choose the framework/library/stack of your choice. The only difference is that you might not get as many interview offers, since the demand from me is not that great. So, choose wisely.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"is this limited to React/JS only projects?","date":null,"description":null,"type":"faq"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/10_limited_by_tech_stack/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/99_what-if-my-question-is-not-here/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"what if my question is not answered here?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/01.5_has-challenge-strarted/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"is the challenge live now?"}}}}}

And then cross post on all other platforms. But it’s too much of a hassle if you’re a beginner.</p>\n<p>There are various platforms to get started with blogging like. My preference would be in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/\">dev.to</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">linkedIn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hashnode.com/\">hashnode</a></li>\n<li>or <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">medium</a>, .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what you can do instead is: post it on any of the platforms mentioned above, wait for 2-4 days, and then cross post it on other platforms as well. Use your social media handles to publicize it. Check <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/cross-posting-on-social-media-should-you-do-it/\">this article</a> on cross posting if you’re serious about blogging. For this competition however, you don’t need to do so much. Just get few blogs published.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"how do I start blogging?","date":null,"description":null,"type":"faq"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/07_how_to_start_blogging/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/08_how-to-get-visibility/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"how to get more visibility in community?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/07.5_what-to-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"what should I blog about?"}}}}}

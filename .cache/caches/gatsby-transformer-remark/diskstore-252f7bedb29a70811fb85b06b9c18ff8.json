Participation is open to all stacks and all languages. If there are more projects on Python or ML, I’ll get mentors to review them as well.

An API you made which gives random quotes. Good. But did you document it? Did you make a documentation site for it? Did you provide enough examples for end users to use it? Did you ask people in this group to build on that API using your docs? This makes a half stack project complete.</p>\n<p>Let me give you another example. Suppose you made a dashboard theme. Good. Great! But did you make it configurable? Do you have a plain HTML version and a React version? Again, did you document it well?</p>\n<p>Make a half stack project complete by documenting and asking other developers to build on it.</p>"}
